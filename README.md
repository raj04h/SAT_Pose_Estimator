# Satellite Pose Estimation using Vision AI

Overview

This project implements an AI-based satellite pose estimation system using computer vision and deep learning.
Given a monocular image of a satellite, the model predicts its 6D pose, which includes:

* Orientation (Quaternion) → (qw, qx, qy, qz)

* Translation (Position) → (x, y, z)

The predicted pose is then visualized in 3D space to demonstrate how the satellite is oriented relative to the observing camera.

This type of perception system is important for space robotics tasks such as:

* On-orbit servicing

* Autonomous rendezvous and docking

* Space debris removal

* Satellite inspection missions
